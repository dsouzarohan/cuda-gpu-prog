// size_t = size type for memory allocation
// size_t is an unsigned integer type used to represent sizes of objects and array indexes in bytes
// It is guaranteed to be big enough to contain the size of the biggest object the host system can handle
// the size of int can vary (16-bit, 32-bit, etc.), but size_t always matches the architectureâ€™s address space

// That means:
// On 32-bit systems, size_t can represent up to 4 GB.
// On 64-bit systems, it can represent up to 16 EB.
// This ensures functions like malloc() or sizeof() always return a type that can hold any valid memory size on that machine.

# include <stdlib.h>
